* 04/06/2025 : First time making a so big backend. The reason : Authentification ! Yes i wanted to try that one day, and here we are ! I almost finished the python unit test part (i am testing every view with APIClient from DjangoRestFramework). So soon, it will be time to start the Ionic frontend 😊
